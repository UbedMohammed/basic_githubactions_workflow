üöÄ GitHub Actions Workflow for TodoApp

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate CI/CD processes for the TodoApp project. The workflow is defined in the .github/workflows/main.yml file. Below is an explanation of how the workflow works and how you can customize it for your needs.

üìù Workflow Overview

The workflow, named TodoApp Workflow, is triggered by push events to the main and feature/** branches. The job defined in the workflow uses a self-hosted runner to execute the steps.

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Configuration

The main components of the GitHub Actions workflow configuration are as follows:

Triggers
The workflow is set to run on push events to the main branch or any feature branch (feature/**), ensuring that any updates to these branches will trigger the workflow.

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'main'
      - 'feature/**'


Job Definition
The workflow contains a job named todoapp_workflow. This job runs on a self-hosted runner, which means it is executed on an environment that you manage yourself (not on GitHub's hosted VMs).

jobs:
  todoapp_workflow:
    name: 'todoapp workflow'
    runs-on: self-hosted


Steps
Inside the job, there is a step that simply outputs a message Mera Pahla Todoapp Workflow to the console. This is just a placeholder step to demonstrate how to define the steps in the workflow.

steps:
  - name: 'todoapp workflow_steps'
    run: echo 'Mera Pahla Todoapp Workflow'


In this step:

name: The name of the step is todoapp workflow_steps.
run: The run command is used to execute a shell command, in this case, echo 'Mera Pahla Todoapp Workflow', which prints the message to the log.

üõ† How to Use This Workflow

Create Your Own Workflow File
Navigate to your project‚Äôs repository.
Create the .github/workflows/ directory if it does not already exist.
Inside this directory, create a new YAML file (e.g., main.yml).
Copy the workflow configuration into your main.yml file.
Customize the Workflow
Adjust the on trigger section if you want to run the workflow for other events (like pull_request or schedule).
Replace the placeholder step (echo) with actual build, test, or deployment commands depending on your needs.

Set Up Self-Hosted Runner (If Needed)

If you are using a self-hosted runner, ensure that it is properly set up and connected to your GitHub repository. Follow GitHub‚Äôs documentation
 for setting up a self-hosted runner.

Push Changes

After making changes to the workflow file, commit and push it to your GitHub repository:

git add .github/workflows/main.yml
git commit -m "Add basic GitHub Actions workflow"
git push origin main

üîç Workflow Log

After pushing to the configured branch (main or feature/**), you can view the workflow logs by navigating to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository. Here you can monitor the progress, view step logs, and troubleshoot any issues.

üìñ Step-by-Step Explanation

Triggering the Workflow
The workflow is triggered by any push to the main branch or any branch starting with feature/. This is defined under the on section in the YAML file.

Executing the Job
The job todoapp_workflow is executed on a self-hosted runner. If you do not have a self-hosted runner, GitHub Actions will not be able to run the workflow unless you adjust the runs-on property to a hosted runner like ubuntu-latest.

Defining Workflow Steps
The workflow includes one basic step that uses the run command to output a string. This demonstrates the basic structure of a step, but you can replace it with commands like npm install or npm test to perform actions relevant to your project.

Viewing Workflow Status
GitHub Actions provides real-time feedback through logs. You can access these logs by going to the Actions tab in your repository after pushing the changes.

üèó Customizing Further
Once you're familiar with this basic setup, you can expand it by:
Adding more steps to run tests or deploy the application.
Using matrix builds to test across multiple environments (like Node.js versions or OS types).
Setting up notifications to inform you of failed builds.

Automating deployments to your production environment after a successful build.
